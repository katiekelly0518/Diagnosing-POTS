# Diagnosing-POTS

**Project Name:** Diagnosing Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (POTS)

**Description:** This project asks a user various questions about their symptomology and lab results pertaining to postural orthostatic tachycardia synrome (POTS) and then makes a recommendation for a diagnosis. 

**Installation:**
1. We used MATLAB via UF Apps to create this code.
2. Download the code from the GitHub repository.
3. Either download the provided example datasets or create .mat files for data of your own.
4. Navigate to your Downloads folder on your device.
5. Open the code in MATLAB to run it.

**Usage:** This project can be used as a tool to aid in determining a diagnosis for a patient based on both qualitative symptoms and quantitative lab results. This code is not meant to be used a final determinant in a diagnosis, but only as a clinical aid. 

**Examples:** Example data sets that we used in testing the code are included in this repository for your convienence. We examined both child-bearing, pre-menopausal aged patients and non-child-bearing, pre-menopausal aged patients for our analyses.
